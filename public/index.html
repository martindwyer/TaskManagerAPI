    <h3><br>Application Features</h3>
    <p><br>TaskManagerAPI represents a RESTful Web Service which can be used for creating and managing application users
      as
      well as comprehensive task management. The TaskManagerAPI has designed operations which allow front-end users to;
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Establish new users with as little as a name, email address, and password.</li>
      <li>Store the user credentials in a MongoDB database with passwords hashed for security purposes.</li>
      <li>Authenticated users can change their user attributes or delete their own user profile.</li>
      <li>Using the SendGrid API, users are sent emails when they join or leave the service.</li>
      <o>Authenticated users can create new tasks with the following attributes:
        <li>task name
          <ul>
            <li>task start date</li>
            <li>task due date</li>
            <li>task completed status</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Depending on user preference, emails can be sent to the user daily for;
          <ul>
            <li>tasks which are due that day</li>
            <li>tasks which are overdue, or </li>
            <li>all future or undated tasks.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Similarly, users can retrieve lists of all tasks based on search criteria.</li>
        <li>Using the Jest testing framework, comprehensive tests have been conducted for the system.</li>
    </ol>
